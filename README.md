# Ethereum-Price-Prediction
Predict Ethereum price based on blockchain information. Compare the Deep Learning approach with traditional ML algorithms.

### 1. Project Overview


### 2. Dataset

### 3. Evaluation
- We have a very good result with the LSTM model in Ethereum price prediction
  - R2 Score:  0.94
  - Mean Absolute Error:  215.07
  - Mean Squared Error:  92685.31
 
- We also have top 3 best traditional machine learning models in predicting the Ethereum price:
  - Lasso Regression with the accuracy is 98%
  - Ridge Regression with the accuracy is 97%
  - Linear Regression with the accuracy is 95%
